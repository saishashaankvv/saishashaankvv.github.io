If you are running this code on your local machine, you will have to run a simple http server in your project folder.

If you have node js installed in your machine, then simply do :

>npm install -g http-server

and then in your project folder run the command : 

>http-server

This will start up a local server in your project folder. Navigate to http://localhost:8080 and you will see your app running locally.

Alternatively, you can run a XAMPP Server or any other http server as well.
